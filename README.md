   - Choose an art style theme
   - Tap "Generate" to create the image
3. **Add Text Elements**:
   - Use the toolbar to add speech bubbles, thought bubbles, captions, or sound effects
   - Drag elements to position them
   - Tap to edit text content
   - Pinch to resize elements
4. **Add Characters** (Optional):
